Adding backend to project : 
- @google/genai is the SDK you’re using (GoogleGenAI).
- express for the tiny server.
(express provides tools for backend)
- dotenv for .env support.
- cors to allow your Vite frontend to call the backend during dev.


Setting up API Key:
Firstly, please read this guide from Vite to understand what we're about to do: [Env Variables and Modes](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode). 
- add api key to .env with VITE_ in front to make it accessible to the code
- add .env to gitignore so that it isn't pushed to the github
